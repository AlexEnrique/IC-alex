0 - Determine the number os steps to avoid transient states (functions.h)
1 - Implement totalEnergy() function in the function.h file
2 - Implement a dynamic graphic visualization via JavaScript for flip probability as a function of time.
3 - Implement a dynamic graphic visualization via JavaScript for some observables as a function of time.
4 - Determine a way to calcule the free energy (or the partition function) stachastically.
5 - Design a new algorith for the flip dynamic (notes in the green notebook).
6 - (At the final) Try to use machine learning to minimize the energy.
