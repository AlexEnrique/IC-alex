# Simulações para o projeto final de iniciação científica - Alex Enrique Crispim.

This is the repository of the computational simulation of the project "Mapeamento Clássico-Quântico: estudo do modelo de Ising em duas dimensões".


* There are folders with the main code and the data of the simulation of observables (<code>MainSimulationCode</code> and <code>ObservablesData</code>, respectively), obteined from the main code. Also, there are graphs created with gnuplot from the data of the simulation inside the folder <code>ObservablesGraphs</code>.
* A visual simulation made with JavaScript can be found on the [branch IsingJS-v1.2](https://github.com/AlexEnrique/IC-alex/tree/IsingJS-v1.2) of this repository. The instructions to the simulation programa are within that branch.
